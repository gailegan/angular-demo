<h1>AngularJS Boilerplate</h1>
<blockquote>
An easy way to start a fresh AngularJS project
with all the fundamentals components: router, controllers, directives, filters, services, templates and more...
The project contains a reset.css file and includes the bootstrap css as well.
The project should be hosted on a webserver( or local server ) in order to run.
When running the project it should be already set with a 'click' directive,
an 'addtext' filter and a simple 'HttpLoader' - an http service, examples.<br />
